## MoSCoW Prioritization

I used MoSCow prioritization to organize each iteration of my project.

### Must Have

- **Design and implement a relational data model**: I'll need to design the database structure that fits the needs of the yacht rental service, making sure it can store, manage, and manipulate all relevant data.
  
- **Authentication, authorization, and permission features**: It’s essential that I handle who can log in, what they can do, and protect sensitive areas of the site. I’ll be making sure that only authorized users can make bookings or manage content.

- **E-commerce payment system**: I'll implement a payment system that allows users to securely book and pay for yacht rentals directly through the site.

- **Use version control (Git) and deploy to the cloud**: I’m documenting everything in Git, making regular commits, and hosting the project on a cloud platform like Heroku.

### Should Have

- **Full-stack web app using Django**: I’ve designed a multi-app Django project with a relational database and user interactions.

- **Accessible and user-friendly front-end**: I'm ensuring the site is designed with accessibility in mind and provides a smooth user experience.

- **Forms for users**: I'll have forms with validation, allowing users to submit and edit information easily.

- **Clean code**: I'll make sure the code follows Django conventions and is easy to maintain.

- **Custom Python logic**: I'll include Python functions with logic like loops and conditions to handle the yacht rental process and bookings efficiently.

- **Testing**: I'll run tests to check that everything works properly—from responsiveness to data management.

- **Database design**: I've created a database schema that shows clear relationships between yachts, users, and bookings.

- **CRUD functionality**: I'll provide the ability to create, read, update, and delete records like yachts and bookings, making sure the system works smoothly for both admins and users.

### Won’t Have

- **Referral system**: This feature is something I’m skipping for now, as it’s not critical to the core of the project.

## Project Setup
### 1. Commitizen Setup
- Installed **Commitizen** and **cz-customizable** for standardized commit messages.
- Created and configured `.cz-config.js` to define commit types and scopes.

### 2. Virtual Environment
- Created a virtual environment for the project to manage dependencies.
- Added the `env` directory to `.gitignore` to prevent tracking of the virtual environment files.

### 3. Django Installation
- Installed **Django** version 5.1.1 to start developing the application.

### 4. Project Initialization
- Began the project setup for YachtsEscape.com, aimed at providing a platform for yacht rentals.

#### Running the Django Application

To start the Django application, follow these steps:

1. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   Make sure your virtual environment is activated. Run the following command:

   - **For Windows:**
     ```bash
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **For macOS and Linux:**
     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

### Colour Scheme

#### Color Palette
The color palette for YachtsEscape was chosen to give the site a clean, professional look, while keeping it tied to the theme of yachting. Here are the main colors:

- **Primary Color:** #088cdc (Light Blue) – Inspired by the sea, this color feels fresh and calm. It's used for buttons, icons, and other important elements to give the site a bright, welcoming feel.
- **Secondary Color:** #006bb3 (Deep Blue) – This darker blue adds depth and trust. It's used for the logo, hover states, and interactive elements.
- **Text Color:** #444444 (Dark Grey) – Used for main body text, this grey keeps things readable without being too harsh.
- **Background Color:** #f8f8f8 (Light Grey) – A soft, neutral background that lets the content shine without being distracting.
- **White:** Mainly used for text on dark backgrounds like the footer and image sections, creating strong contrast for easy reading.
- **Footer Background:** #000000 (Black) – The footer uses black to make the white text stand out and give the site a solid base.

#### Visual Harmony and Accessibility
- **Contrast and Readability:** High contrast between text and background ensures everything is easy to read. The white text on dark sections like the footer improves visibility.
- **Balance:** Blue dominates the design, while grey and white keep the layout clean and focused.
- **Consistency:** The color scheme is consistent throughout, reinforcing the brand identity and making navigation intuitive.
- **Accessibility:** The colors meet accessibility standards, ensuring the site is usable for everyone, including those with visual impairments.

![Colour Palette](docs/images/ux/color-palette.webp)

#### Visual Harmony and Accessibility

- **Contrast and Readability**: Ensure there is sufficient contrast between the primary color (Green) and the accent color (White) for text and important elements to maintain readability.
- **Balance**: Use soft orange sparingly to highlight key actions without overwhelming the natural and calm aesthetic of the site.
- **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent use of colors throughout the website to create a harmonious visual experience that supports the site’s calming and professional atmosphere.
- **Accessibility**: Consider accessibility guidelines, ensuring that all text is readable by maintaining an appropriate contrast ratio and using color combinations that are friendly for users with color vision deficiencies. This includes testing the color palette with accessibility tools to verify compliance with WCAG standards.

### Typography

The primary font used throughout the site is [**Lato**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato), a Google Font, chosen for its clean and modern look, ensuring readability across all devices. It comes in various weights (100, 300, 400, 700, 900) to give flexibility in styling headings, body text, and other elements.

![Lato Google Font](docs/images/ux/lato-google.webp)

For icons, I use [**Font Awesome**](https://fontawesome.com/), which adds clarity and visual appeal to buttons, social media links, and navigation elements.

### YachtsEscape Logo

The **YachtsEscape** logo features a sleek, modern design with a minimalist illustration of a yacht, combined with bold typography. The yacht symbol uses a clean blue (#088cdc) color, which represents the ocean, aligning with the overall maritime theme of the website. The bold black text beside the yacht adds a professional touch, making the brand name stand out clearly.

There are two variations of the logo:

- **Light Version**: This version is used against dark backgrounds, such as in the initial state of the header and in the footer of the website.
- **Dark Version**: This version appears against lighter backgrounds, such as when the user scrolls down and the header becomes fixed on a white background.

![YachtsEscape Dark Logo](docs/images/ux/logo-dark.png)
![YachtsEscape Light Logo](docs/images/ux/logo-light.webp)

The logo dynamically changes between these versions based on the user's scroll position and screen width, enhancing the website's aesthetic and functionality.

Below is the JavaScript code that switches between the light and dark versions of the logo as the user interacts with the page:

```javascript, static/js/base.js
// Function to change the logo based on scroll position and window width
function updateLogo() {
    let windowWidth = $(window).width();
    let scrollTop = $(window).scrollTop();
    let lightLogo = $("#logo").data("light-logo");
    let darkLogo = $("#logo").data("dark-logo");
    let smallLightLogo = $("#logo").data("small-light-logo");
    let smallDarkLogo = $("#logo").data("small-dark-logo");

    if (scrollTop > scrollTrigger) {
        // Change logo to dark version based on screen size
        if (windowWidth < 689) {
            $("#logo").attr("src", smallDarkLogo);
        } else {
            $("#logo").attr("src", darkLogo);
        }
    } else {
        // Change logo to light version based on screen size
        if (windowWidth < 689) {
            $("#logo").attr("src", smallLightLogo);
        } else {
            $("#logo").attr("src", lightLogo);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Logout Issue

**Problem:**
When a user clicks the "Log Out" link and confirms the logout, the user is redirected to the homepage, but the navigation menu still shows the logged-in state (i.e., it still shows "Profile" and "Log Out" instead of "Log In" and "Sign Up"). Additionally, the user can still access the profile page.
**Steps to Reproduce:**

1.  Log in to your account.
2.  Click the "Log Out" link.
3.  Confirm the logout.
    **Cause:**
    The issue was caused by the JavaScript code for the logout not being correctly executed within the context of the Flask application, leading to the user session not being properly terminated on the server side. This issue is specific to how Jinja templates are rendered and how JavaScript interacts with the Flask backend.
    Initially, the JavaScript code for the logout was included in a custom JavaScript file. This caused the problem as described because the Jinja templating was not correctly interacting with the external JavaScript file. Once the code was moved directly into the `base.html` template, everything worked as expected.
    **Solution:**
    Ensure the JavaScript code is included at the right place in the `base.html` template to properly interact with the Flask backend:

            ```html
            <!-- Inline script for logout modal -->
            <script>
              $(document).ready(function () {
                // Attach a click event handler to the confirmLogout button
                $("#confirmLogout").click(function () {
                  // Redirect the user to the logout URL
                  window.location.href = "{{ url_for('logout') }}"
                })
              })
            </script>
            ```

After implementing the above solution, the logout functionality works as expected, with the user being properly logged out and the navigation menu updating correctly to reflect the logged-out state.

#### User Email Update Issue

**Problem:**
When a user updates their email address in the profile settings, the user remains logged in with the new email address, but they are redirected to the home page. Upon returning to the profile page, the user’s profile information is displayed correctly, but a “User not found” notification appears at the top of the page.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

    1.	Log in to your account.
    2.	Go to the profile page.
    3.	Click the “Edit” button to enable editing mode.
    4.	Change the email address to a new valid email address.
    5.	Enter the current password and click “Save.”
    6.	Observe the redirection to the home page.
    7.	Navigate back to the profile page.
    8.	Observe the “User not found” notification at the top of the page.

**Expected Behavior:**

    •	The user should remain on the profile page after updating the email address.
    •	No “User not found” notification should appear if the profile information is displayed correctly.

**Actual Behavior:**

    •	The user is redirected to the home page after updating the email address.
    •	A “User not found” notification appears at the top of the profile page upon returning.

**Screenshot:**
![Bug 3, User not found Message](documentation/bugs/3/bug-3-1.webp)

**Cause:**
The issue was caused by the Flask application not correctly updating the session and redirecting after an email change. Although the session email was updated, the redirection logic did not reflect the new session state, leading to the user being treated as unauthenticated or non-existent in subsequent requests.

**Solution:**
Ensure that after updating the email in the session, the user is redirected correctly and the session state is fully updated:

      ```python
      # Update session email if changed
      if current_email != new_email:
          session["user"] = new_email
          flash("Your email has been updated to {}.".format(new_email), "success")
          return {"success": True, "message": "Your email has been updated.", "redirect": url_for("profile", username=new_email)}
      else:
          flash("Your information has been updated.", "success")
          return {"success": True, "message": "Your information has been updated.", "redirect": url_for("profile", username=current_email)}
      ```

Ensure the JavaScript handles the success response correctly:

      ```javascript
      success: function (response) {
        if (response.success) {
          alert(response.message);
          window.location.href = response.redirect; // Updated to redirect after successful email change
        } else {
          alert(response.message);
        }
      }
      ```

After implementing the above solution, the email change functionality works as expected, keeping the user authenticated with the new email address and displaying the appropriate success message on the profile page.

### Unsolved Bugs

To the best of my knowledge, there are no unresolved bugs at the
moment.

### Mistakes

- As I reached the end of this project, I realized the immense benefits of incorporating Agile methodologies for large-scale projects. Agile's iterative approach, flexibility, and focus on collaboration can significantly enhance project management and delivery.

- I plan to dive deeper into Agile practices starting today, right after I submit this project. By adopting Agile techniques, I aim to improve my workflow and better handle complex projects in the future.

- Initially, failed to document encountered bugs promptly during the coding process.
- Realised the importance of documenting bugs in real-time for better tracking and resolution.

- In future projects, I commit to maintaining a detailed log of encountered bugs and their resolution steps throughout the development process.

## Commit Conventions
This project uses [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) to standardize commit messages. The majority of the commits have been made using `git cz`, which helps in maintaining a consistent commit history.

To make a commit using Commitizen, run:
```bash
git cz
```

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://yachtsescape-a7b4e5d759f6.herokuapp.com/).

### PostgreSQL Database

This project uses a [Code Institute PostgreSQL Database](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net).

To obtain my own Postgres Database from Code Institute, I followed these steps:

- Signed-in to the CI LMS using my email address.
- An email was sent to me with my new Postgres Database.

> [!CAUTION]  
> - PostgreSQL databases by Code Institute are only available to CI Students.
> - You must acquire your own PostgreSQL database through some other method
> if you plan to clone/fork this repository.
> - Code Institute students are allowed a maximum of 8 databases.
> - Databases are subject to deletion after 18 months.

### Stripe API

This project uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to handle the ecommerce payments.

Once you've created a Stripe account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.

- From your Stripe dashboard, click to expand the "Get your test API keys".
- You'll have two keys here:
  - `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` = Publishable Key (starts with **pk**)
  - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` = Secret Key (starts with **sk**)

As a backup, in case users prematurely close the purchase-order page during payment, we can include Stripe Webhooks.

- From your Stripe dashboard, click **Developers**, and select **Webhooks**.
- From there, click **Add Endpoint**.
  - `https://yachtsescape-a7b4e5d759f6.herokuapp.com/booking/wh/`
I have selected three events:  
- `checkout.session.completed`  
- `payment_intent.payment_failed`  
- `payment_intent.succeeded`
- Click **Add Endpoint** to complete the process.
- You'll have a new key here:
  - `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` = Signing Secret (Wehbook) Key (starts with **wh**)

### Gmail API

This project uses [Gmail](https://mail.google.com) to handle sending emails to users for account verification and purchase order confirmations.

Once you've created a Gmail (Google) account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.

- Click on the **Account Settings** (cog icon) in the top-right corner of Gmail.
- Click on the **Accounts and Import** tab.
- Within the section called "Change account settings", click on the link for **Other Google Account settings**.
- From this new page, select **Security** on the left.
- Select **2-Step Verification** to turn it on. (verify your password and account)
- Once verified, select **Turn On** for 2FA.
- Navigate back to the **Security** page, and you'll see a new option called **App passwords**.
- This might prompt you once again to confirm your password and account.
- Select **Mail** for the app type.
- Select **Other (Custom name)** for the device type.
  - Any custom name, such as "Django" or scrub-savers
- You'll be provided with a 16-character password (API key).
  - Save this somewhere locally, as you cannot access this key again later!
  - `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` = user's 16-character API key
  - `EMAIL_HOST_USER` = user's own personal Gmail email address

### Cloudinary API
This project uses [cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) to host media files. 

1. Create a Cloudinary Account

2. Sign up for a Cloudinary account. During registration, select Programmable Media and Files as your intended use.
Set Up Cloudinary in env.py

3. After registration, copy your Cloudinary URL and add it to your env.py file:
  `os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "YOUR_CLOUDINARY_URL")`
- Later, transfer this to your Heroku config variables. 
4. In Heroku, add the environment variable:

  `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1`
5. Install the necessary Cloudinary packages:
  `pip install cloudinary==1.41.0 dj3-cloudinary-storage==0.0.6`
6. Add the following to the INSTALLED_APPS list in the correct order in your settings.py:
  ```python
  INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'cloudinary_storage',
    'cloudinary',
  ]
  ```


7. Make sure to import Cloudinary at the top of your settings.py:

`import cloudinary`

8. Add cloudinary configuration at the bottom of your static files declation in settings.py:

`cloudinary.config(secure=True, )`

### Django WhiteNoise
This project uses [Django WhiteNoise](https://whitenoise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/django.html) to serve static files
1. Install Whitenoise using pip:

`pip install whitenoise`

2. Add Whitenoise to the top of your middleware stack, right after the SecurityMiddleware:

```python
MIDDLEWARE = [
  'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
  'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',  # Add this line
  ...
]
```

3. Ensure you have the following static file settings in your settings.py:

```python
# Static file settings
STATIC_URL = '/static/'

# Location where static files are collected
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
```

4. Run the following command to collect all static files into the STATIC_ROOT directory:

`python manage.py collectstatic`

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` | user's own value |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | user's own value |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` | user's own value |
| `CLOUDINARY_URL` | user's own value |



Heroku needs three additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile
- runtime.txt

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

The **runtime.txt** file needs to know which Python version you're using:
1. type: `python3 --version` in the terminal.
2. in the **runtime.txt** file, add your Python version:
  - `python-3.9.19`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
  - `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os


os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_PASS", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_USER", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
os.envirpn.setdefault("DEVELOPNENT", "1")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `⌘+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

If you'd like to backup your database models, use the following command for each model you'd like to create a fixture for:

- `python3 manage.py dumpdata your-model > your-model.json`
- *repeat this action for each model you wish to backup*

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pagaslav/yachtsescape-com) 
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it 
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal

## Future Improvements

Websites with a backend structure similar to this project offer a wide range of opportunities for continuous improvement and modernization. This ongoing evolution is driven not only by advancing technologies but also by the practical experiences of a real working team. As the team uses the site and gains real-world insights, the site can be further customized and adapted to meet the specific needs of the team and business.

Here are a few key improvements planned for the future:

1. **Enhanced Appointment Management System**
  - Develop a more intuitive appointment management system that simplifies each stage of the process. This includes allowing admins to easily view, edit, and delete appointments as needed. The goal is to make the system as user-friendly and efficient as possible for all users involved.

2. **Addition of Articles and Helpful Materials**
  - Add articles and useful materials to the site that address issues related to the clinic's profile or prepare patients for various procedures. This will provide valuable information and support to patients, enhancing their experience and knowledge.

3. **Search Functionality**
  - Implement a search mechanism for the website. This will enable users to search through articles, doctors to search for patients, and admins to search through all users. This feature will enhance the usability and efficiency of the platform.

4. **Interactive Image**
  - The main page of this project was designed to include an interactive image feature. However, due to time constraints, this feature was not implemented in the current version. I plan to add this interactive element in future updates to enhance the user experience and functionality of the site.

5. **And Much More**
  - Continuously add features and improvements as necessary, based on real-world use and feedback from the team and users. This ongoing development will ensure the platform remains relevant and effective in meeting its users' needs.
