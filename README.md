## MoSCoW Prioritization

I used MoSCow prioritization to organize each iteration of my project.

### Must Have

- **Design and implement a relational data model**: I'll need to design the database structure that fits the needs of the yacht rental service, making sure it can store, manage, and manipulate all relevant data.
  
- **Authentication, authorization, and permission features**: It’s essential that I handle who can log in, what they can do, and protect sensitive areas of the site. I’ll be making sure that only authorized users can make bookings or manage content.

- **E-commerce payment system**: I'll implement a payment system that allows users to securely book and pay for yacht rentals directly through the site.

- **Use version control (Git) and deploy to the cloud**: I’m documenting everything in Git, making regular commits, and hosting the project on a cloud platform like Heroku.

### Should Have

- **Full-stack web app using Django**: I’ve designed a multi-app Django project with a relational database and user interactions.

- **Accessible and user-friendly front-end**: I'm ensuring the site is designed with accessibility in mind and provides a smooth user experience.

- **Forms for users**: I'll have forms with validation, allowing users to submit and edit information easily.

- **Clean code**: I'll make sure the code follows Django conventions and is easy to maintain.

- **Custom Python logic**: I'll include Python functions with logic like loops and conditions to handle the yacht rental process and bookings efficiently.

- **Testing**: I'll run tests to check that everything works properly—from responsiveness to data management.

- **Database design**: I've created a database schema that shows clear relationships between yachts, users, and bookings.

- **CRUD functionality**: I'll provide the ability to create, read, update, and delete records like yachts and bookings, making sure the system works smoothly for both admins and users.

### Won’t Have

- **Referral system**: This feature is something I’m skipping for now, as it’s not critical to the core of the project.

## Project Setup
### 1. Commitizen Setup
- Installed **Commitizen** and **cz-customizable** for standardized commit messages.
- Created and configured `.cz-config.js` to define commit types and scopes.

### 2. Virtual Environment
- Created a virtual environment for the project to manage dependencies.
- Added the `env` directory to `.gitignore` to prevent tracking of the virtual environment files.

### 3. Django Installation
- Installed **Django** version 5.1.1 to start developing the application.

### 4. Project Initialization
- Began the project setup for YachtsEscape.com, aimed at providing a platform for yacht rentals.

#### Running the Django Application

To start the Django application, follow these steps:

1. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   Make sure your virtual environment is activated. Run the following command:

   - **For Windows:**
     ```bash
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **For macOS and Linux:**
     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

### Colour Scheme

#### Color Palette
The color palette for YachtsEscape was chosen to give the site a clean, professional look, while keeping it tied to the theme of yachting. Here are the main colors:

- **Primary Color:** #088cdc (Light Blue) – Inspired by the sea, this color feels fresh and calm. It's used for buttons, icons, and other important elements to give the site a bright, welcoming feel.
- **Secondary Color:** #006bb3 (Deep Blue) – This darker blue adds depth and trust. It's used for the logo, hover states, and interactive elements.
- **Text Color:** #444444 (Dark Grey) – Used for main body text, this grey keeps things readable without being too harsh.
- **Background Color:** #f8f8f8 (Light Grey) – A soft, neutral background that lets the content shine without being distracting.
- **White:** Mainly used for text on dark backgrounds like the footer and image sections, creating strong contrast for easy reading.
- **Footer Background:** #000000 (Black) – The footer uses black to make the white text stand out and give the site a solid base.

#### Visual Harmony and Accessibility
- **Contrast and Readability:** High contrast between text and background ensures everything is easy to read. The white text on dark sections like the footer improves visibility.
- **Balance:** Blue dominates the design, while grey and white keep the layout clean and focused.
- **Consistency:** The color scheme is consistent throughout, reinforcing the brand identity and making navigation intuitive.
- **Accessibility:** The colors meet accessibility standards, ensuring the site is usable for everyone, including those with visual impairments.

![Colour Palette](docs/images/ux/color-palette.webp)

#### Visual Harmony and Accessibility

- **Contrast and Readability**: Ensure there is sufficient contrast between the primary color (Green) and the accent color (White) for text and important elements to maintain readability.
- **Balance**: Use soft orange sparingly to highlight key actions without overwhelming the natural and calm aesthetic of the site.
- **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent use of colors throughout the website to create a harmonious visual experience that supports the site’s calming and professional atmosphere.
- **Accessibility**: Consider accessibility guidelines, ensuring that all text is readable by maintaining an appropriate contrast ratio and using color combinations that are friendly for users with color vision deficiencies. This includes testing the color palette with accessibility tools to verify compliance with WCAG standards.

### Typography

The primary font used throughout the site is [**Lato**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato), a Google Font, chosen for its clean and modern look, ensuring readability across all devices. It comes in various weights (100, 300, 400, 700, 900) to give flexibility in styling headings, body text, and other elements.

![Lato Google Font](docs/images/ux/lato-google.webp)

For icons, I use [**Font Awesome**](https://fontawesome.com/), which adds clarity and visual appeal to buttons, social media links, and navigation elements.

### YachtsEscape Logo

The **YachtsEscape** logo features a sleek, modern design with a minimalist illustration of a yacht, combined with bold typography. The yacht symbol uses a clean blue (#088cdc) color, which represents the ocean, aligning with the overall maritime theme of the website. The bold black text beside the yacht adds a professional touch, making the brand name stand out clearly.

There are two variations of the logo:

- **Light Version**: This version is used against dark backgrounds, such as in the initial state of the header and in the footer of the website.
- **Dark Version**: This version appears against lighter backgrounds, such as when the user scrolls down and the header becomes fixed on a white background.

![YachtsEscape Dark Logo](docs/images/ux/logo-dark.png)
![YachtsEscape Light Logo](docs/images/ux/logo-light.webp)

The logo dynamically changes between these versions based on the user's scroll position and screen width, enhancing the website's aesthetic and functionality.

Below is the JavaScript code that switches between the light and dark versions of the logo as the user interacts with the page:

```javascript, static/js/base.js
// Function to change the logo based on scroll position and window width
function updateLogo() {
    let windowWidth = $(window).width();
    let scrollTop = $(window).scrollTop();
    let lightLogo = $("#logo").data("light-logo");
    let darkLogo = $("#logo").data("dark-logo");
    let smallLightLogo = $("#logo").data("small-light-logo");
    let smallDarkLogo = $("#logo").data("small-dark-logo");

    if (scrollTop > scrollTrigger) {
        // Change logo to dark version based on screen size
        if (windowWidth < 689) {
            $("#logo").attr("src", smallDarkLogo);
        } else {
            $("#logo").attr("src", darkLogo);
        }
    } else {
        // Change logo to light version based on screen size
        if (windowWidth < 689) {
            $("#logo").attr("src", smallLightLogo);
        } else {
            $("#logo").attr("src", lightLogo);
        }
    }
}
```

#### HTML
I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate all of my HTML files.

During the testing and validation phase, an error that occurred in the early stages of writing the HTML code was identified. In the header, I created a class named header, which is considered potentially problematic. So far, I have not noticed any issues related to this. In the next stages of website development, I will, of course, correct this oversight. Since this error is in the header template, it appears on all pages. Otherwise, the code did not produce any more errors, only informational messages and warnings, mostly related to the Django template syntax.

The other pages (Yacht Management, User Management, adding yachts, or editing user profiles) are not accessible without administrator privileges, so it was pointless to validate them since the validation would repeatedly check the same page — the login page.

#### CSS
The following CSS files were validated to ensure that the styles used in the **YachtsEscape** project are error-free:

- **base.css**
- **header.css**
- **footer.css**
- **responsive.css**
- **index.css**
- **yacht-list.css**
- **about.css**
- **allauth.css**

The validation process for all styles was smooth and successful. Due to the nature of the project, I found the most straightforward and efficient method to validate each stylesheet was to directly transfer the code via clipboard. The result was the same for every file: 

**"Congratulations! No Error Found."**

Below is the confirmation screenshot for the successful validation:

#### JavaScript
I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com/) to validate my JS file.

### Resolved Bugs

#### 1. Bug Report: Flatpickr Disabling All Dates

##### Description
A bug was identified in the yacht booking system where the **Flatpickr** date picker was incorrectly disabling all available dates instead of only those with a "confirmed" status. This issue significantly impacted user experience by preventing users from selecting dates that should be available for booking.

##### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open the yacht booking page.
2. Attempt to select a date range using the **Flatpickr** date picker.
3. Observe that all dates are disabled, regardless of their booking status.

##### Expected Behavior
Only dates that have been confirmed as booked should be disabled in the **Flatpickr** date picker. Users should be able to select any available dates for their bookings.

##### Actual Behavior
The **Flatpickr** date picker disabled all dates, making it impossible for users to select any available booking dates.

##### Impact
This bug led to frustration among users trying to make bookings, as it restricted their options unnecessarily.

##### Resolution
The issue was resolved by reviewing the logic used to determine which dates should be disabled in the **Flatpickr** configuration. Now, only dates with a confirmed booking status are included in the array of disabled dates passed to **Flatpickr**, improving user experience.

---

#### Bug Report: Unresolved Issue on Yacht Management Page - Fleet Navbar Button Appears Blue

##### Description
A bug was identified on the yacht management page where the "Fleet" navigation button is displayed in blue, even when the user is not on the fleet page. This happens because the URL starts with `/yachts`, incorrectly highlighting the button as active.

##### Steps to Reproduce
1. Log in as an administrator.
2. Navigate to the yacht management page.
3. Observe the "Fleet" button in the navigation bar.
4. Notice that the "Fleet" button is highlighted in blue, even though the user is not on the fleet page.
5. Verify the URL starts with `/yachts`.

##### Expected Behavior
The "Fleet" button should only be highlighted when the user is on the fleet management page. It should reflect the actual active section.

##### Actual Behavior
The "Fleet" button is highlighted incorrectly, confusing users by suggesting they are in the fleet section when they are not.

##### Impact
This can cause confusion for users, as it misrepresents the current page and may lead to navigation issues. However, this issue is only visible to administrators, as the yacht management section is only accessible to users logged in as administrators.

    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'cloudinary_storage',
    'cloudinary',
  ]
  ```


7. Make sure to import Cloudinary at the top of your settings.py:

`import cloudinary`

8. Add cloudinary configuration at the bottom of your static files declation in settings.py:

`cloudinary.config(secure=True, )`

### Flatpickr API

![Flatpickr API](docs/images/features/yacht-detail-calend.webp)

The **Flatpickr** library makes date selection easy and user-friendly in the yacht booking system. Here’s a quick overview of how it works:

#### 1. Easy Setup
Flatpickr is attached to the date input field (`#dateRange`), letting users pick a date range for their yacht booking. It starts working right after the booked dates are loaded, ensuring only available dates are shown.

#### 2. Selecting Dates
Users can select a start and end date for their booking. The system uses the `Y-m-d` date format to keep things consistent.

#### 3. Blocking Booked Dates
The system loads already booked dates from the server and blocks those dates in the calendar, so users can’t select unavailable times.

#### 4. Tracking Selected Dates
Selected dates are saved in a global variable (`selectedDateRange`), making it easy to access and use them throughout the system.

#### 5. Handling Date Changes
When users pick new dates, the system listens for changes and saves the new dates in an array (`dateRange`) to be sent when the booking form is submitted.

#### 6. Booking with Flatpickr
Once the user clicks **Book Now**, the selected dates are sent as part of the booking request. The system handles the submission smoothly.

### Why Flatpickr?

- **User-Friendly**: The calendar is easy to use and makes date picking quick and simple.
- **Error-Free**: Blocked dates help avoid booking mistakes.
- **Flexibility**: Users can select a range of dates, which is important for booking yachts.

Flatpickr improves the booking process by making it easier for users to choose dates and ensuring they can’t book unavailable times.

### Django WhiteNoise
This project uses [Django WhiteNoise](https://whitenoise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/django.html) to serve static files
1. Install Whitenoise using pip:

`pip install whitenoise`

2. Add Whitenoise to the top of your middleware stack, right after the SecurityMiddleware:

```python
MIDDLEWARE = [
  'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
  'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',  # Add this line
  ...
]
```

3. Ensure you have the following static file settings in your settings.py:

```python
# Static file settings
STATIC_URL = '/static/'

# Location where static files are collected
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
```

4. Run the following command to collect all static files into the STATIC_ROOT directory:

`python manage.py collectstatic`

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` | user's own value |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | user's own value |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` | user's own value |
| `CLOUDINARY_URL` | user's own value |



Heroku needs three additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile
- runtime.txt

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

The **runtime.txt** file needs to know which Python version you're using:
1. type: `python3 --version` in the terminal.
2. in the **runtime.txt** file, add your Python version:
  - `python-3.9.19`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
  - `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os


os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_PASS", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_USER", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
os.envirpn.setdefault("DEVELOPNENT", "1")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `⌘+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

If you'd like to backup your database models, use the following command for each model you'd like to create a fixture for:

- `python3 manage.py dumpdata your-model > your-model.json`
- *repeat this action for each model you wish to backup*

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pagaslav/yachtsescape-com) 
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it 
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
